# DIY-Photobooth

I had designed the electronics housing box to store the electronics for the DIY photobooth. 

Materials USed: 
- White Poster Board 
- 9V 
- White Contruction Paper
- Tape 
- LED strip light 
- 9V to 5V Converter Module 
- Switch 

1. Draw out the box enclosure leaving one side open so that you are able to take photos of the product. (Front Face of the box) 
2. Measure where you want the LED lights to be placed. I placed four lights in parallel with each otehr so that each area of the box will be uniform. (at the top of the box) 
3. Solder wires to the LED strip light and place a heat shrink so that the wires would not short. 
4. Tie all the (+)  LEDs end together and all the (-) LEDs end together. 
5. Place your LEDs lights in the box and hide the wires outside the box to connect the positive and negative to the output terminals of the module. 
5. Connect the module to a source and place a voltage meter on the output of the module. Turn the potentiometer to the desire output voltage. 
6. Connect your LED lights to test your results (adjust if necessary) 
7. Solder the input battery terminals to the 9V to 5V module. Then connect the output side to the LED lights. 
8. Place it inside the 3D printed enclosure. 
9. Done! 
10. Ready to use. 

I made this photobooth to create an aesthetic image for my siblings to use when they are taking pictures of their products to post on Instagram or any type of social media platform.
